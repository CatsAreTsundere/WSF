<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granblue_Fantasy">GranblueFantasy</a> is a really fun game that is heavily inspired by Square Enix</p>
<p>I really enjoy the story, it revolves around the sky. There are continent islands that are floating over clouds and no one knows what lies beneath them.</p>

<p id="named"></p><p>They are followed a little dragon called Vyrn (be careful not to call him a lizard)</p>
