<h1 style="color:red;">Gunpla building is a niche hobby even in its country of origin</h1>
</h1>
<p>In general, model kit building is a very rare hobby that people get into. To me, its just a really relaxing experience.</p>
<p>Which out of the model types would you be interested in</p>
<form action="/choice.php">
    <select name="kit" size="5" multiple>
        <option value="robots">Robots</option>
        <option value="cars">Cars</option>
        <option value="plane">Planes</option>
        <option value="trains">Trains</option>
        <option value="boats">Boats</option>
    </select>
</form>

<p>If you chose robots, well do I have something in store for you</p>
<P>Gundam is an old japanese animated series that dates back to 1979. Most of the main series (made in a time line called the Universal Century). It's a series about people riding giant robots into war, and how war is not good. That on any side of the conflict, sometimes theres no good or bad. There's just people. Trying to survive.</P>

<p>But I'm not here to talk about all that heavy stuff, I'm here to show what Gundam Plastic Model Kits are. Gunpla can be seperated into many different grades. The grades signify mostly the level of detail and size. The three main grades are:</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="alert('1/144 Scale with minimal detail')">High Grade</button> <button type="button" onclick="alert('1/144 Scale with High levels of detail')">Real Grade</button> <button type="button" onclick="alert('1/100 Scale with Mid to High level of detail')">Master Grade</button>

<p>People are usually intimidated by this hobby because of all the warnings about how fragile model kits are. From my experience as long as you aren't being an absolute monkey, you should be fine.</p>
<p>People usually recommend starting with the HG Grandpa Gundam aka the Original Rx-78-2.</p>
